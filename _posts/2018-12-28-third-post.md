title: Advice on starting out Deep Learning

Recently, one of my friends working in the Data Science industry asked me for advice about a quick way to jumpstart his learning for Deep Learning. I do not claim that I am an expert on this but the path I have chosen has helped me immensely in kick starting both the theory and applied side of Deep Learning.

One commonly asked question I hear from my friends is whether you need a strong math or/and stats background. Strong math and stats background definitely helps but lacking that should not deter you from learning, even if you have phobia of taking your college level Linear Algebra, Multivariable Calculus and Theory of Probability. The usefulness of Deep Learning application(to this date, it never fails to amaze me how cool [Deep Learning](http://deeplearninggallery.com/) is) to some of you may motivate you to review your Linear Algebra and Multivariable class to further deepen your understanding of how the theory motivates the application of deep learning.
